My open source projects are primarily an artifact of various personal projects. Currently the only ones under active development are *Package Control*, *asn1crypto* and *oscrypto*.

*I generally will add contributors to repos once they have shown a pattern of useful contributions, be it responding to issues or sending PRs.*
