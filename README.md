Iâ€˜m a principal engineer on [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), having been working on the product since 2016. I also handle design work for Sublime HQ. I began my involvement in the Sublime community in 2011, and wrote [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

My open source projects are primarily an artifact of various personal projects. Currently the only one under active development is *Package Control*, but the crypto packages are maintained.

*I generally will add contributors to repos once they have shown a pattern of useful contributions, be it responding to issues or sending PRs.*
